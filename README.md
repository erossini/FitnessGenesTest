# Fitness Genes test

Systematic examination (often as peer review) of computer source code intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase, improving both the overall quality of software and the developers' skills.

The aim of this task is to examine a piece of code that your colleague has written. You must critically analyse and report on the quality of the code and review it for any mistakes, bugs or issues that you feel are present. You can make any comments, improvements or suggestions that you feel are appropriate about style, design and logic.

Please write any review comments inline in the code below in bold red text.

There is no time or word limit but try to not spend too long completing the task â€“ a good guideline is about 30 minutes. Treat it as if it were a real review in your day as a developer.

This example is massively contrived and intentionally badly coded; don't expect code like this in your day to day life.
General comments on the code and design:

## Code and comments
You find my code in this repository. There are some generic best practises I'm following:
- I organize the code in functional folders: for example in `Interfaces` folder you find all interfaces I use in the project; in `Models` folder I collect models across the projects and so on.
- If there is a function like `ToNumber()`, it is a good example of an `Extensions`
- If more classes are functions in common, I prefer to create a base class

### SmallFilter
It is an example of implementation of `OrderFilterBase`. The purpose of it is to have a filter for size. I assumed you have more functions in this implementation and then you have to create you `virtual` functions in the base class. If you don't have any other functions, `OrderFilterBase` is not needed.

### OrderManager
OrderManager is responsible to read orders from a store and write them. I refactored this class like that

    public class OrderManager<T> where T : OrderFilterBase
    
Now you create a new `SmallManager` or `LargeManager` inherits from `OrderFilterBase`: `OrderFilterBase` has all functions to manage orders, the only difference is the number of order you want to filter, as default is 0. I'm not sureyou really need this class because there is only a filter on the list of orders but I assumed you need it.

## Final point of view
If I don't know the real scope of this code, I find difficult to model the right code. With more details I can code a better implementation for what you need.
